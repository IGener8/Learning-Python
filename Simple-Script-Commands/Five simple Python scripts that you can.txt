#Five simple Python scripts that you can try running:

#Printing a message to the console:

print("Hello, World!")

#Storing a value in a variable and printing it:

x = 10
print(x)

#Using a for loop to print the numbers 1 to 10:

for i in range(1, 11):
    print(i)

#Defining a function to add two numbers and printing the result:

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

print(add(3, 4))

#Reading and printing the contents of a file:

with open('file.txt', 'r') as f:
    contents = f.read()
    print(contents)
